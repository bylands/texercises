# each app stays a folder of its own for deployment; pages that are no app (the privacy page and the
# hub, whose lang.js is served as /lang.js) get lang.js only. Edit the files here, never an app's copy.
#   shared/sync.sh          copy
#   shared/sync.sh --check  only report copies that differ (exit 1 if any)
# KaTeX is not copied: the apps share one copy, katex/ at the top of the repository, served as
# /katex/ (on the server /var/www/teachingphysics/katex/, deployed like an app). It is KaTeX 0.16.9
# (MIT, see katex/LICENSE) with the woff2 fonts only, so that no page loads anything from another
# server, and the browser caches it once for all apps.

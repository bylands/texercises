# lang.js and objectives.json at the web root) and the admin panel's program (hub-admin/hubadmin.py, which nginx does
# not serve; the service restarts by itself when it changes), with rsync. Only changed files are sent (by checksum) and nothing on

# DEPLOY_TARGET is where the web root is (default: the SSH host infomaniak_vps). The GitHub
# Action (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) deploys as the user tpdeploy, whose key may only run
# rsync into the web root (rrsync), so its target is relative to it: tpdeploy@host:
# Not deployed here (both need sudo): the admin panel's systemd units (see
# hub-admin/hub-admin.service) and the nginx site (deploy/nginx/, see README.md). A new app needs neither: nginx serves every folder in
# the web root.
